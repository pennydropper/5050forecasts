      <description>Introduction Here’s some simple advice that, once said, makes so much sense that I wonder if it really needs saying.
When you’re delivering a key message or report in a work environment, consider adopting the “What, So What, Now What” framework.
Take, as an example, a demand review presentation when the Demand Manager presents the update. If you’re unfamiliar with and S&amp;amp;OP structure, the objective of the monthly demand review is to achieve consensus on sales plans and forecasts that are then published to the broader business.</description>

      <description>Introduction Last week, my team applied a new approach with great success to our performance retrospective. The approach worked so well that I’m standing up and evangelising the approach for a wider range of teams than those like our’s who apply Agile.
 Retrospective Goals and Objectives The goal of our sprint (i.e. our 3-week activity cycle) retrospective is to improve our systems and processes to drive business value.</description>

      <description>Which is the best department to oversee Demand Planning: Sales, Supply or Finance? This question, often asked, lends itself to my experience of at least 2 years under each of these departments within FMCG businesses.
 Finance from 2006 to 2008
 Supply from 2008 to 2011
 Sales from 2011 to 2015  This blog post, mixing my own observations with my own opinions, covers the following areas:</description>

A demand planner was recounting how her team was travelling OK but she felt that there was scope for significant improvement.
For one thing, she felt that her team’s stakeholders didn’t really understand what the team did “beneath the bonnet” and would struggle to explain what value that they added to the business. There was, certainly, general satisfaction in the team’s output and people would say that, from the outside, that they were working well together, but that also reflected that stakeholders were somewhat unaware of the internal machinations.</description>
