      <description>What’s better; making the wrong decision for the right reasons or making the right decision for the wrong reasons? If it’s one-off, then the right decision for the wrong reasons (also known as a fluke), is likely to receive plaudits. However, if it’s part of a decision making process recurring every month, such as sales forecasting, then I’ll back the wrong decision for the right reasons (also known as bad luck) every time.</description>

      <description>Pure Blonde Lager was easily the most successful new product launch in my time at Foster’s Group. The story goes that the concept was rushed through as senior management was concerned with the slim pickings in the new product pipeline. Almost immediately from when this lo-carb beer was launched, sales exceeded forecasts, leaving almost everyone in the supply chain scrambling to keep up. And it wasn’t just the warehouses that were screaming for more stock, it was the bottling lines, brewing facilities and packaging suppliers.</description>

      <description>Which is the best department to oversee Demand Planning: Sales, Supply or Finance? This question, often asked, lends itself to my experience of at least 2 years under each of these departments within FMCG businesses.
 Finance from 2006 to 2008
 Supply from 2008 to 2011
 Sales from 2011 to 2015  This blog post, mixing my own observations with my own opinions, covers the following areas:

      <description>Demand planning team “going OK / not going OK”!
A demand planner was recounting how her team was travelling OK but she felt that there was scope for significant improvement.
For one thing, she felt that her team’s stakeholders didn’t really understand what the team did “beneath the bonnet” and would struggle to explain what value that they added to the business. There was, certainly, general satisfaction in the team’s output and people would say that, from the outside, that they were working well together, but that also reflected that stakeholders were somewhat unaware of the internal machinations.</description>

      <description>“Forecasts are deliberately wrong”
Whoa! This confronting remark shot back at me when telling a data science colleague that I am an experienced Demand Manager. A part of my shock came from knowing deep down that I could see where he was coming from despite always striving towards achieving a “50/50” forecast; i.e. a forecast with a 50% chance of sitting too high balanced by a 50% chance of sitting too low.</description>
