      <description>Introduction Boutique brewery numbers have exploded in Australia in the past 2 decades. So much so that the growth in demand for boutique brews has led corporate brewing companies, CUB, Lion, Asahi and Coca Cola Amatil, to acquire and establish their own boutique beer brands. Data taken from http://craftbeerreviewer.com/the-brewery-list/ shows that 701 boutique brewing brands now operate around Australia.
While I’m yet to find data on the historical growth of craft beers in Australia, Goldstein Research forecasts the Australian market to reach $345 million by 2025 with CAGR of over 5%.</description>

      <description>What’s better; making the wrong decision for the right reasons or making the right decision for the wrong reasons? If it’s one-off, then the right decision for the wrong reasons (also known as a fluke), is likely to receive plaudits. However, if it’s part of a decision making process recurring every month, such as sales forecasting, then I’ll back the wrong decision for the right reasons (also known as bad luck) every time.</description>

      <description>Pure Blonde Lager was easily the most successful new product launch in my time at Foster’s Group. The story goes that the concept was rushed through as senior management was concerned with the slim pickings in the new product pipeline. Almost immediately from when this lo-carb beer was launched, sales exceeded forecasts, leaving almost everyone in the supply chain scrambling to keep up. And it wasn’t just the warehouses that were screaming for more stock, it was the bottling lines, brewing facilities and packaging suppliers.</description>
