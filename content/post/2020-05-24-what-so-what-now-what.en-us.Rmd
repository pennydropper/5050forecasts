# Introduction  
Here’s some simple advice that, once said, makes so much sense that I wonder if it really needs saying.

When you’re delivering a key message or report in a work environment, consider adopting the **“What, So What, Now What”** framework.

Take, as an example, a demand review presentation when the Demand Manager presents the demand plan update.  If you’re unfamiliar with the S&OP structure, the objective of the monthly demand review is to achieve consensus on sales plans and forecasts that are then published to the broader business.

**Start with the What**  
Present unambiguous facts with the appropriate level of detail:  

- How recent sales compared against forecasts and business commitments.
- How recent sales activity performed against assumptions.
- How the total market performed against assumptions.
- Highlight key brands or channels as appropriate.

It’s important that the “What” section presents irrefutable facts that are supported by data where appropriate.  It’s also important to frame the facts at a level of detail appropriate for the audience and the allocated time.

**So What**  
Generally, the "So What" presents the implications of the "What" in terms of people, process, technology or economics.  The “So What” section for a demand review particularly presents the business / commercial implications.  Ideally, business implications are framed in business terms, for example: gross sales revenue; net margin; total volume; market share.  

- What are the updated assumptions at a market, brand and product level, where relevant?
- Along the lines of this point, what’s changed with the planned sales activity.
- What are the updated forecasts against commitment (budget) at portfolio and brand level.

The key with this section is to report at a high level or by exception, i.e. which brands have significantly changed.

**Now What**  
The “Now What” section has 2 main distinct objectives:  

1. Present recommendations requiring senior management decisions.
2. Present a summary of highlights of the next period’s plan.

In the Agile Showcase presentations, the “Now What” agenda item presents the next steps taken from the backlog, or presents recommendations to the product owners for strategy refinements.

**Alternatives to the What / So What / Now What Framework**  
The What / So What / Now What framework is just one of many frameworks available to help deliver key messages. Other well-known frameworks that work well in the right applications include:  

- Past / Present / Future
- Short-term / Long-term
- Increase / Decrease
- Cause / Effect

However, the What / So What / Now What is, arguably, the most relevant to most business briefings.

**Definitions**  
*What*  

- Lists the facts.

*So What*  

- Why these facts are relevant or significant.
- Relate the facts to the tangible commercial, system, process or personal impact.

*Now What*  

- Present options and recommendations.
- Next steps, if already determined.


**Benefits**  
Quite simply, the key benefit is that it conveys the key messages more effectively; the key messages being here are the facts, this is the significance and here are the next steps or key decisions.

Implicitly, the structure considerably aids the listener with digesting the messages.  The listener knows to listen out for the key elements in the presentation.

**Implicit in McKinsey-style Feedback**
This framework is so applicable that McKinsey incorporate it into their personal feedback model, as I observed in training sessions and in this [Working with McKinsey blog](http://workingwithmckinsey.blogspot.com/2012/11/giving-mckinsey-style-feedback-model.html){target="_blank"}.

The framework is reworded though it is essentially the same:  

>*"When you did [X], it made me feel [Y]. In the future, I would recommend that you do [Z]"*

**Key Consideration - Prime the Audience**  
The key consideration with the What / So What / Now What is that the audience is primed for receiving the message.  

For a Demand Review meeting, the audience should receive a briefing pack prior to the meeting and would thus be prepared for the key discussion points.  All the same, the agenda should prime the recipients, much the same way advised by Dale Carnegie:  

>“Tell the audience what you're going to say, say it; then tell them what you've said”.  
>*Dale Carnegie*

For team meetings presented by a program leader, the “priming” would depend upon the objective of the meeting.  A regular meeting solely to foster team spirit and requiring no pivot would require no priming.  On the other hand, a team meeting announcing changes that impact on individuals would require “priming”.  The sort of priming could come in the subject line of the meeting and then in the introduction to the meeting.

For personal feedback (a la the McKinsey-style feedback), finding a safe place and time to deliver the message is a form of priming. I also like to start my feedback by asking “can I give you some feedback”, which I intend to create safety as well as to gain acknowledgement from the receiver that they are open to feedback.

**In Summary**  
*What*  
The What / So What / Now What framework is one option for how to frame key messages in business settings.

- “What” describes the key facts relevant to the message.
- “So What” lists the key implications: commercial, system, process and personal.
- “Now What” presents and recommends the next steps, as well as listing decision points.

*So What*  
This framework is remarkably effective at delivering key messages:  

- It helps the presenter to think clearly through how to deliver those key messages.
- It also helps the audience to follow those messages.

*Now What*  

- I recommend considering this framework for almost all key presentations.
- Consider how you “prime” the audience for the key messages and, where necessary, how to create appropriate “safety”.
